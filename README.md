# About

Passify is a gatepass management mobile app that was created to digitise the existing outpass system at IIIT Allahabad. 

The protoype was built in 36 hours at the SheHacks 2024 national level hackathon where the project secured the 3rd position. 



## Problem Solved

The existing system at IIITA requires female students to obtain a physical "outpass" from the hostel warden to leave campus after 6 PM, which is often inconvenient and restrictive. Passify is a smartphone application that allows students to request and obtain outpasses that can be granted and verified electronically, making the process faster, more convenient, and secure.
